Fork of the project described Bennett McElwee here:
[http://www.thunderguy.com/semicolon/2007/08/14/elementready-jquery-plugin/](http://www.thunderguy.com/semicolon/2007/08/14/elementready-jquery-plugin/).

I adapted the plugin so that it is possible now to poll for the
existence of an element even after the DOM is in `ready` state. Thanks
to this modification you can now for example plug new features
unobstrusively as soon as an element appears after an AJAX call.
